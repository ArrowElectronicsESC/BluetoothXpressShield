The SLASH1000A is a development and prototyping tool built by Arrow Electronics with the intent to speed time to market and increase ease of development for Bluetooth integrated products. This shield provides a host of useful components suitable for integration with the common Arduino prototyping environment. The shield is designed to work with Arduino Uno based boards as well as Arduino MKR based boards as the host processor. Libraries are also provided to aid in reducing software development times. The SLASH1000A is broken into three categories: Core, Sensing, and Control. See the SLASH1000A User Guide for more details on these functionalities.


To add the SLASH1000A Libraries to the Arduino IDE:
1. Download the repository as a .zip (Or clone the repo locally for advanced users)
2. Extract the files to a known location.
3. In the Arduino IDE Navigate to "Sketch>Include Library>Add ZIP Library"
4. Navigate to the unzipped repository files and select the "/LibraryFiles/ArrowBGXShield" folder for incluision
5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 with "/LibraryFiles/BluetoothExpress"
